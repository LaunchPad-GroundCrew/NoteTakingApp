    return `Create an image with a very dark, nearly black center occupying about 75% of the total area. Surround this dark center with a vibrant halo effect inspired by expressionist painting styles, featuring nature-based imagery. The halo should be based on the following sentiment, concepts, and vegetation: ${topics}.

  Use a color scheme of ${colorScheme}. The intensity of the colors should correspond to the sentiment intensity of ${sentimentIntensity.toFixed(
      2
    )} on a scale from 0 to 1.

  The halo should be intense and detailed at the edges of the image, gradually diffusing and fading as it approaches the dark center, creating a smooth transition. The expressionist style in the halo should use bold, emotional brushstrokes with ${brushstrokeDescription}. The overall mood should feel ${moodDescription}.

  Within the halo, paint ${vegetationDescription}. The vegetation should be rendered in an expressionist style, becoming more defined towards the edges and more abstract as it approaches the center.

  Include abstract shapes or symbolic elements related to the topics, seamlessly integrated into the expressionist vegetation. These elements should become more defined towards the edges and more abstract as they approach the center.

  Ensure the dark center remains largely empty and very dark to allow for clear visibility of overlaid elements. The final effect should resemble a window of darkness framed by an emotive, expressive border of nature that tells a story about the content's mood and themes through color, brushstrokes, and abstract symbolism in vegetation.`;
